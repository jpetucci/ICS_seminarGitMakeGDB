Working examples for Make and GDB for use in the ICS Training Series

The slides that go with this give an introduction to version control, build automation and debugging.

Users will use git to get these example files, we will go through the various Make files and then use GDB on ACI-I to find the problem with the included code, which calculates factorial of an input.  The code is far more complicated than it needs to be (three c files) but this is to help show how make and gdb can be used on more complicated examples.
